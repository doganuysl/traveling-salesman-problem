## The Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)

The Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) is one of the classic problems in computer science and optimization. It involves finding the shortest possible route that visits a given set of cities and returns to the starting point. It is necessary to minimize the total distance or time in visiting each city exactly once and returning to the starting point.

### Solution
One of the most common approaches is to use a brute force search algorithm. This algorithm simply lists all possible permutations of cities and selects the one with the shortest total distance.

The time complexity of the brute force algorithm is *O(n!)*, where n is the number of cities. This implies that the algorithm will take exponentially more time as the number of cities increases. This indicates that the algorithm is not efficient when used for large data sets or a large number of cities.
